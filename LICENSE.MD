# Overview
I am personally not a fan of licenses, and I generally believe that people will do "the right thing" in the form of giving credit where credit is due, I offer the portions of this project that I can Public Domain. People may choose to leave credit where credit is due, or they may not. If they choose, I would hope that they simply leave a note like the following:

	This software utilizes JavaFX Data Tag Support library by Glenn R. Martin, more information can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/grmartin/JavaFX-Data-Support. 
	
Again, this acknowledgment is 100% optional.
